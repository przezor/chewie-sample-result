A vigilante is just a man lost in scramble for his own gratification. He can be destroyed or locked up. But if you make yourself more than just a man, if you devote yourself to an idel and if they can&#39;t stop you then you become something else entirely.

And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you&#39;ve truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra&#39;s Al Ghul&#39;s destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.</p><p>Alfred: Take a look, his speed, his ferocity, his training. I see the power of belief. I see the League of Shadows resurgent.</p><p>Lucius Fox: Do you want my opinion? You need to lighten up.</p><p>Alfred: I&#39;m not sure you made it loud enough, sir.</p><p>Batman: It&#39;s ends here.</p><p>Lucius Fox: Very well. Death!

Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You&#39;re skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?</p><p>Search him. Then I will kill you.</p><p>But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege.</p><p>Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.</p><p>You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with.

The fear of death.</p><p>You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.</p><p>The first time I stole so that I wouldn&#39;t starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong.

After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy&#39;s home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It&#39;s like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that&#39;s all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I&#39;d seen that look on your face before. It&#39;s the same one I taught myself. I don&#39;t why you took the fault for Dent&#39;s murder but I&#39;m still a believer in the Batman.

### Introduction

Batman: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

Falcone: No gun? I'm insulted.

Joker: Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?

Ra's Al Ghul: Death does not wait for you to be ready! Death is not considerate of fair! And make no mistake, here you face death. Tiger. Jujitsu. Panther. You're skilled. But this is not a dance. And you are afraid. But not of me. Tell us Mr. Wayne, what do you fear?

Joker: You see, I'm a guy of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite and gunpowder and gasoline.

Batman: Swear to me!

Rachel: Maybe someday, when Gotham no longer needs Batman I'll see him again.

Alfred: I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

Joker: Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

Alfred: The city needs Bruce Wayne, your resources, your knowledge. It doesn't need your body or your life. That time is past.

Alfred: It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.

Ra's Al Ghul: You have learn to bury your guilt with anger. I will teach you to confront it and to face the truth.

Thomas Wayne: Gotham's been good to our family, but the city's been suffering. People less fortunate than us have been enduring very hard times. So we built a new, cheap, public transportation system to unite the city. And at the center, Wayne tower.

Alfred: Just know that there are those of us who care about what you do with your future.
